# Sentiment Analysis: "Artificial Intelligence"
The purpose of this project was to address the question "how is AI covered in the news?" The project leveraged MediaCloud, an open source platform for studying media ecosystems, to generate a data set of news headlines covering artificial intelligence between January 2019 and January 2020. In addition to some descriptive analysis on amount of coverage per publication, sentiment analyzer tools Vader and TextBlob were used to score each headline as positive, negative, or neutral. After taking the output of the sentiment analyzers and visualizing each publication's average score in Tableau, interesting divergences could be found between the two tools, as well as clear cases of failure in sentiment assignment. Further recommendations on areas to explore are then explored.
